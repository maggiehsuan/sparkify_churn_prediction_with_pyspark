# Sparkify_Churn_Prediction_with_Pyspark

This project is a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to analyze user behavior and to predict churn on Sparkify music app data. The dataset is a mini subset (128MB) of the full dataset (12GB), which contains information on Sparkify user's activities for about two months from 1st October 2018â€“03rd December 2018.

## Project Motivation
Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. The ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data.

## Installations
Python
Spark
Pyspark
pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook.

## File Descriptions
Sparkify.ipynb - Notebook containing feature explorations, visualizations and modeling 


## Results 
We generated from the exploration of user's behavior several features and implemented with the
created features different models with five ML algorithms to train and test the dataset. The F1 score
is our metric to evaluate the model performance.
